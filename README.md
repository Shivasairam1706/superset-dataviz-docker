# Superset Data Visualization Stack with Docker

This project sets up [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) for data visualization, using Docker Compose. It includes a custom Superset image, PostgreSQL for metadata storage, and Redis for caching and session management. It’s built for professionals who want a flexible, production-ready stack for data exploration and dashboarding.

---

## Techniques Used

- **Multi-service Docker Compose** to manage a Superset stack with PostgreSQL and Redis. See [Docker Compose v3.7](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-37).
- **Custom Dockerfile** extending the official `apache/superset` image with system dependencies and extra Python libraries.
- **Entrypoint shell scripting** using `bash` and [pg_isready](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-isready.html) for startup sequencing.
- **Healthchecks** using `curl` to ensure service readiness ([Docker healthcheck](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck)).
- **Environment-based configuration** using `.env` and `superset_config.py` to load environment variables securely and conditionally adjust settings.

## Notable Libraries and Technologies

- [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/): data exploration and dashboarding platform.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): in-memory store used here for session and cache backend.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): metadata store for Superset.
- [psycopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/): PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/), and [fastparquet](https://fastparquet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): support various dataset formats.
- [odfpy](https://pypi.org/project/odfpy/): OpenDocument Format parsing.

## Directory Breakdown

- `docker-init/` — Holds the `superset_bootstrap.sh` script for first-time container setup: running DB migrations, admin creation, and `superset init`.

- `superset_config/` — Contains the custom `superset_config.py`, which configures feature flags, caching, and session handling using environment variables.

---

## First Release Goals

- Provide a reusable local Superset setup with sane defaults

- Allow easy customization of Python requirements

- Bootstrap Superset with necessary database config and admin setup

- Enable Redis-based performance tuning and scalable session management
